How to Use Power BI at UTD
1. Logging In
First, you must submit a request for access to UTD Power BI.


It may take 1–2 days for approval.


Once approved, you can:


Use the online version through Microsoft 365, OR


Download Power BI Desktop and log in with your UTD credentials.


Either option works the same.

2. Creating a Report
Start a Report


Open Power BI and select Blank Report.


If you don’t see that option, click Get Data to start building from your dataset.


Import Data


Power BI supports many sources: Excel tables, SQL databases, etc.


For this assignment, we used Excel files (most UTD sample data comes in Excel).


You can import multiple sheets into one report.


Transform Data


Go to the Home tab → Transform Data.


Here, you can clean, edit, or organize your data before using it in reports.


Add Visuals (Charts/Graphs)


On the right panel, you’ll see a list of chart and graph types.


Drag fields from your imported dataset(s) into the visual.


You can mix data from different sheets into the same report.


Multiple Pages


At the bottom of the report, click the + icon to add more report pages.



3. Publishing and Sharing Your Dashboard
Save Your Report


Name and save your report once you’re finished building.


Publish to Dashboard


Go to the Home tab → Share → Publish.


Select My Workspace as the location.


Once published, you can view your dashboard in the browser.


Convert Report → Dashboard


In the online workspace, open your report.


Go to File → Embed Report.


From here, you can generate a shareable link or an embed code.



4. Embedding Your Dashboard
When publishing, you’ll see two options:


Copy Link – Share directly.


Embed in App – Copy embed code for websites or apps.


For apps/websites, you can paste the embed link inside an iframe. 
Data Connections Beyond Excel


You mentioned Excel and SQL, but Power BI also connects to SharePoint, Azure, CSV files, APIs, and many other sources.


Sometimes people will need to connect live to a database instead of importing static Excel sheets.


Data Modeling (Relationships & Measures)


Power BI isn’t just for charts — you can build relationships between tables (e.g., one Excel sheet for sales, another for customers).


You can also create calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). This is a big part of Power BI.


Filters and Slicers


You can add slicers to let users filter data interactively (like choosing a date range or category).


Filters can be applied to individual visuals, a whole page, or the entire report.


Formatting and Design


You can customize colors, labels, and themes.


Power BI lets you align visuals and add text boxes, images, and shapes for cleaner reports.


Sharing & Permissions


To share dashboards, sometimes users need Power BI Pro licenses (UTD may provide this, but it’s worth mentioning).


You can control whether others can edit, view-only, or re-share your reports.


Refreshing Data


If you’re pulling from Excel or a database, you can set up scheduled refreshes so your report updates automatically.


This is especially important for ongoing dashboards.
